# Kawaii Animated

Big sparkly kawaii eyes with smooth SMIL animations. The killer feature.

## Animations

Each emotion has unique subtle animations:

- **neutral** - Gentle blink every 4 seconds
- **happy** - Sparkles twinkle, gentle blink every 3 seconds
- **sad** - Tears drop slowly, eyes slightly droop
- **angry** - Eyes pulse/throb red with intensity
- **surprised** - Eyes widen then settle back
- **worried** - Eyes dart left-right nervously
- **sleepy** - Slow blink, zzz float upward
- **excited** - Sparkles rotate around eyes, eyes bounce
- **confused** - One eye squints, question mark bobs
- **focused** - Pupils track left-right like reading

## Technical Details

- Uses SMIL `<animate>` and `<animateTransform>` for all animations
- Designed for 15fps rendering at 3-second loops
- Each SVG is self-contained with embedded animations
- Animations are subtle and natural, not overwhelming
